## ðŸš€ **Project List**

**Smart Retail Engine**
Description: A comprehensive project exploring various techniques for personalized product recommendations, including time series forecasting, RFM analysis, customer clustering (K-Means and Autoencoders), and several recommendation strategies (RFM-based, Popular, Item-Based, User-Based, Hybrid). The project includes a Flask backend API and user interfaces built with Gradio, Tkinter, and Streamlit.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Prophet, Flask, Gradio, Tkinter, Streamlit.
