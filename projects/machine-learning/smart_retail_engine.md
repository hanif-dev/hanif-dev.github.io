# Smart Retail Engine: Personalized Product Recommendations - Project Details

## Introduction

Welcome to the detailed page for the Smart Retail Engine project! This project explores various aspects of building a personalized product recommendation system for retail customers. We delve into different analytical and machine learning techniques to understand customer behavior and provide relevant product suggestions.

### ðŸ“Š Project Overview & Techniques

- **Time Series Forecasting (Prophet)**: Modeling sales trends for future predictions.
- **RFM Analysis**: Customer segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
- **Customer Clustering**: Identifying customer groups using K-Means and Autoencoders on RFM features.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Implementing RFM-based, Popular, Item-Based, User-Based, and Hybrid recommendation strategies.
- **Backend API (Flask)**: Exposing recommendation functionalities.
- **User Interfaces (Gradio, Tkinter, Streamlit)**: Providing interactive ways to access recommendations.
