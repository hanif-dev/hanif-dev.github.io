## Data Model

During the preprocessing stage, the data was organized into a relational database structure using MySQL. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) below represents the schema used to store and manage the data efficiently. This relational structure ensures data normalization and eliminates redundancy before further analysis and visualization in Power BI.

The data model consists of 7 tables interconnected to analyze customer demographics, sales transactions, and product details.

The image below shows the tables used in the process:
