## Conclusion  
-Based on the analysis, the churn rate shows significant variability in the early stages of the customer lifecycle, particularly within the first 2000 days since their first purchase. This indicates that newer customers are more prone to churning, highlighting the importance of targeted retention strategies during this critical period. As customers progress in their lifecycle, the churn rate stabilizes, suggesting that long-term customers exhibit more consistent behavior. To reduce churn, efforts should focus on engaging new customers early while maintaining consistent service quality for long-term retention.
-Plan promotions around the holiday season and key events.
