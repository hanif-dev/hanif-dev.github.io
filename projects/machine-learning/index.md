## ðŸš€ **Project List**

**1. Smart Retail Engine: Personalized Product Recommendations**

**Description:** A comprehensive project exploring various techniques for personalized product recommendations in the retail domain. This includes time series forecasting with Prophet, RFM analysis for customer segmentation, customer clustering using K-Means and Autoencoders (TensorFlow/Keras), and several recommendation strategies (RFM-based, Popular, Item-Based, User-Based, Hybrid collaborative filtering). The project is deployed with a Flask backend API and features user interfaces built with Gradio, Tkinter, and Streamlit.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Prophet, Flask, Gradio, Tkinter, Streamlit.
