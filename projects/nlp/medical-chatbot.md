# Medical Chatbot: Intelligent Symptom Analysis & Information Retrieval - Project Details

## Introduction

Welcome to the detailed page for the Medical Chatbot project! This project focuses on developing an AI-powered conversational agent designed to assist users with symptom analysis and health information retrieval. It emphasizes accurate understanding of medical queries in Bahasa Indonesia through advanced Natural Language Processing techniques.

### ðŸ§  Project Overview & Techniques

-   **Intelligent Symptom Analysis**: Building a system capable of interpreting user-inputted symptoms and health concerns.
-   **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Implementing a custom NER module to identify and extract crucial medical entities (e.g., diseases, symptoms, medications, body parts) from Bahasa Indonesia text.
-   **IndoBERT Integration**: Utilizing the pre-trained **`indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1`** model via Hugging Face Transformers for robust linguistic understanding and feature extraction specific to Indonesian language.
-   **Contextual Information Retrieval**: Directing users to relevant health information based on identified entities and inferred medical context.
-   **Interactive User Interface (Streamlit)**: Developing an intuitive web application for users to interact with the chatbot easily.
