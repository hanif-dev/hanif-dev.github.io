# Smart Retail Engine: Personalized Product Recommendations - Project Details

## Introduction

Welcome to the detailed page for the Smart Retail Engine project! This project explores various aspects of building a personalized product recommendation system for retail customers. We delve into different analytical and machine learning techniques to understand customer behavior and provide relevant product suggestions.

## Project Phases and Techniques

**1. Time Series Forecasting (Prophet)**
Description: In the initial phase, we focused on understanding sales trends over time. We utilized the Prophet library to build models for forecasting future sales, which can inform inventory management and strategic planning.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Prophet.
Key Insights: [Link to specific findings or notebook section]

**2. RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation**
Description: We segmented customers based on their Recency (how recently they made a purchase), Frequency (how often they purchase), and Monetary value (the total amount they've spent). This segmentation allows for targeted recommendation strategies.
Tools: Python, Pandas.
Key Insights: [Link to specific findings or notebook section]

**3. Customer Clustering with K-Means**
Description: To further understand customer segments, we applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to the RFM features. This helped identify distinct groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors.
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn.

**4. Enhanced Clustering using Autoencoders**
Description: To potentially improve the quality of customer segments, we experimented with Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction on the RFM features before applying K-Means. The aim was to capture more complex patterns in customer behavior.
Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn.

**5. Recommendation Systems**
Description: The core of the project involves building several types of recommendation systems:
    * **RFM-Based Recommendations:** Tailoring recommendations based on the identified RFM segments.
    * **Popular Product Recommendations:** Suggesting widely popular items.
    * **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommending items similar to those a user has previously purchased.
    * **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommending items liked by users with similar purchase histories.
    * **Hybrid Recommendation System:** Combining the strengths of different approaches for more personalized and robust recommendations.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
Key Insights: [Link to specific findings or notebook section for each type]

**6. User Interface Development**
Description: To interact with the recommendation engine, we developed several user interfaces:
    * **Gradio Web Application:** An initial, rapidly prototyped web interface for experimentation.
    * **Tkinter GUI:** A more structured desktop application for user interaction.
    * **Streamlit Web Application:** A web-based application designed for deployment and wider accessibility.
Tools: Python, Flask, Gradio, Tkinter, Streamlit.
