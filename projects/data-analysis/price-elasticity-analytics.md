## Key Analysis  

1. **Price Elasticity Analysis for Optimizing Pricing Decisions**  
   This graph shows the relationship between price and the number of sales made. Each blue dot is historical sales data, while the red line is the predicted sales trend based on regression analysis.

2. **Total of Sales Analysis Based on Pricing**  
   Based on the initial analysis using a linear model, we see that sales decrease by 0.8 units for every $1 increase.

## Conclusion  
-From this result, we see that at a price of $20, the estimated sales are around 86 units. To maximize revenue, we need to consider the balance between sales volume and optimal price. 
-With this approach, we can determine the optimal price that not only considers sales volume but also profit margins.
