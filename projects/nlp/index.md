## üöÄ **Project List**

**1. Medical Chatbot: Intelligent Symptom Analysis & Information Retrieval**

**Description:** This project focuses on developing a medical chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries related to symptoms and health information. A key feature is the implementation of **Named Entity Recognition (NER) specifically for Bahasa Indonesia**, leveraging the pre-trained **IndoBERT model (`indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1`)** to accurately identify medical entities like diseases, medications, and symptoms from user text input. The chatbot is designed to provide initial analysis and guide users to relevant information, significantly enhancing query comprehension in a medical context for Bahasa Indonesia. The application features an interactive user interface built with Streamlit.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Sastrawi, Hugging Face Transformers (IndoBERT), Streamlit.
